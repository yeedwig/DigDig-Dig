  - Now I remembered everything..
  - You will need this scrap.. The last piece..
  - And also my shovel..
  - It's been so long since I used it..
  - So probably it won't be able to dig that much only about "10 Blocks"
  - But there is a special power in this shovel..
  - There will be grounds that can only be dug by this shovel.. You'll know it when
    you see it..
  - There is only one shovel so becareful to use it well..
  - I wish you luck my friend..!!
