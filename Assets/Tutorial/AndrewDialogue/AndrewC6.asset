  Dialogues:
  - If you don't think you can make it up towards the surface,
  - You can leave your trail to others who will look for the treasure,
  - 'You will return to the ground, '
  - but others who follow your trail,
  - will still use the structures you left behind.
  - But your inventory and other tools
  - will be gone.
  - So you should plan your way wisely
  - before you start digging underground.
  - Press "P" to give up, and leave your trail.
